# DOSBox-pure Configs

This is a repository for sharing my configuration files that I have made that:
- Automatically start
- Automatically close on application close
- Have sound/video settings built-in
- Automatically mount needed disks


## How to use

Copy over the DOSBOX.BAT file, read the file to find the names of the CDs and
ensure you either change them or rename your CDs, and also copy over the windows
installation if that is required for the game.

## Where to find games/windows cds

Sorry, that is probably illegal even though this software is easily 25 years
old at this point. I attest that all games listed in this repository I
personally own CDs for.

## How can I help?

If you have a game config to share, please fork and create a PR.

If you see something in a config that can be changed to work better, please
create an issue ticket and then supply the fix as well as what it is supposed to
do better.

## Can I request a game?

Add an issue to the repo. I will look into it. I will need to find a copy of the
game, so obscure titles are going to be less likely than ones that are cheap and
easy to get.
